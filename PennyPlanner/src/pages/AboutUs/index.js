                        <br />PennyPlanner is the result of a dedicated effort by Marc and Miko, two passionate developers and finance enthusiasts. <br />
                        This project is part of a comprehensive study that explores the intersection of technology and personal finance. <br />
                        As students, both saw the opportunity to create a tool that not only fulfills academic requirements but also addresses a real-world need.
